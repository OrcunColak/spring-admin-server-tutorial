Spring Boot Admin (SBA) is a community open source project for managing and monitoring Spring Boot applications . It
provides detailed health information, memory information, JVM system and environment properties, garbage collection
information, log setting and viewing, scheduled task viewing, Spring Boot cache viewing and management, etc. Spring Boot
Admin is divided into server ( spring-boot-admin-server) and client ( spring-boot-admin-client). The server and client
use http communication to realize data interaction; integration is required in a single project
spring-boot-admin-clientfor the application to be monitored.
